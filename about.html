<p> I am a 23 year old junior at Adrian College looking to get a major in Data Analytics.
  I play NCAA hockey for Adrian. My goal is to play pro hockey when I am done with college. 
  I am very interested in pursuing sports analytic when my hockey career comes to an end.</p>

  <p>Some of my hobbies include playing tennis, pickleball, golf, and disc golf. Over the past summer I played all of these
  sports but I really gained the interest in pickleball. Next summer I want to compete in a pickleball tournament.</p>
